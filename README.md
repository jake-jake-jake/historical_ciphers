# historical_ciphers
Python library for encrypting, decrypting, and hacking historical ciphers. 
At the moment there are classes implemented for Caesar, Transposition, and
Affine ciphers. More to come.

I'm having a bit of trouble getting the unittest to work for 1000 randomly generated keys in the Affine cipher.
