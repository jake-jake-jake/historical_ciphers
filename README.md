# historical_ciphers
Python library for encrypting, decrypting, and hacking historical ciphers. 
At the moment there are classes implemented for Caesar, Transposition, and
Affine ciphers. More to come.

This library draws heavily from Al Sweigert's book <i>Hacking Secret Ciphers with Pyton</i>. 

# Unit Testing
I've started building a comprehensive unit test script, for kicks. But,
I'm having a bit of trouble getting it to work for 1000 randomly
generated keys in the Affine cipher.
